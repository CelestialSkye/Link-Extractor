# Link-Extractor

Link Extractor & Manager is a Chrome extension designed to help you easily extract and manage links on any webpage. The extension automatically extracts all the links from the page and stores them in your browser's cache for quick access. With two intuitive buttons, you can clear the stored data or refresh it at any time. The built-in search functionality allows you to quickly search through the links, making it easy to find the specific one you're looking for.
